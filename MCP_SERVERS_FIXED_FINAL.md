# ✅ MCP Servers Successfully Fixed!

## 🎉 **PROBLEM RESOLVED**

All 4 MCP servers are now **✓ Connected** and fully functional!

```
sequential-thinking: ✓ Connected
context7:           ✓ Connected  
magic:              ✓ Connected
playwright:         ✓ Connected
```

## 🔍 **Final Root Cause**

The issue was **threefold**:

1. **Configuration Structure**: The settings.json had SuperClaude framework components that Claude Code doesn't recognize
2. **NPX Path Issues**: Claude Code couldn't execute NPX commands through NVM
3. **Package Installation**: The packages needed to be globally installed first

## 🛠 **Solution Applied**

### **Step 1: Global Package Installation** ✅
```bash
npm install -g @modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking @upstash/context7-mcp @21st-dev/magic @playwright/mcp
```

### **Step 2: Direct Binary Paths** ✅  
Instead of using NPX, I configured direct paths to the installed binaries:
- `sequential-thinking`: `/Users/revalue.io/.nvm/versions/node/v22.17.1/bin/mcp-server-sequential-thinking`
- `context7`: `/Users/revalue.io/.nvm/versions/node/v22.17.1/bin/context7-mcp`
- `magic`: `/Users/revalue.io/.nvm/versions/node/v22.17.1/bin/magic`
- `playwright`: `/Users/revalue.io/.nvm/versions/node/v22.17.1/bin/mcp-server-playwright`

### **Step 3: Clean Configuration** ✅
Removed invalid SuperClaude framework components and used Claude Code's native MCP commands:
```bash
claude mcp remove [all servers]
claude mcp add [server] [direct-binary-path]
```
