- Asset organization and management
- Code pattern analysis across files

### **5. Figma MCP - Design Integration** 
**Best for**: Direct design file access (when Figma files are available)

```bash
# Design extraction
claude --with-figma "extract FighterCard component from boxing design file"

# Design token sync
claude --with-figma "sync color palette from Figma design system"

# Asset export
claude --with-figma "export fight poster designs as optimized images"
```

**Status**: Connected but requires design files and authentication setup

# Step 3: Analyze and optimize
claude --with-sequential "review BoxingStatsCard for performance and accessibility"

# Step 4: Integrate into project
claude --with-filesystem "add BoxingStatsCard to component exports and update index"
```

### **Workflow 2: Component Enhancement**
```bash
# Step 1: Analyze current state
claude --with-sequential "analyze FighterCard component for improvement opportunities"

# Step 2: Research improvements
claude --with-context7 "find advanced React animation patterns for sports cards"

# Step 3: Implement enhancements
claude --with-magic "enhance FighterCard with hover animations and improved accessibility"

# Step 4: Validate changes
claude --with-filesystem "test FighterCard integration across all usage locations"
```

### **Workflow 3: Design System Updates**
```bash
# Step 1: Extract design tokens (when Figma available)
claude --with-figma "extract updated color palette and typography from design system"

# Step 2: Update token file
claude --with-filesystem "update design-tokens.ts with new boxing color schemes"

# Step 3: Propagate changes
claude --with-sequential "analyze impact of design token changes across components"

# Step 4: Update components
claude --with-magic "update all boxing components to use new design token structure"
```

## üèóÔ∏è **Advanced Development Patterns**

### **Multi-Server Orchestration**
Combine multiple MCP servers for complex operations:

```bash
# Comprehensive component development
claude --with-sequential --with-magic --with-context7 "create complete FightResults component with data visualization, following React best practices, and implementing boxing design system"

# Full system analysis
claude --with-sequential --with-filesystem --with-context7 "analyze entire component library for consistency, performance, and best practice compliance"
```

### **Boxing-Specific Component Templates**

**Fighter Profile Components**:
```bash
claude --with-magic "create FighterProfile component with:
- Championship timeline visualization
- Fight record statistics with boxing red wins and gray losses  
- Training progress charts with intensity color coding
- Achievement gallery with championship gold highlights
- Social media integration with proper spacing"
```

**Event Management Components**:
```bash
claude --with-magic "create EventDashboard component with:
- Fight card lineup with fighter photos
- Ticket sales progress with animated counters
- Venue capacity visualization
- Countdown timer with boxing-themed styling
- Live streaming integration capabilities"
```

**Training Analytics Components**:
```bash
claude --with-magic "create TrainingAnalytics component with:
- Weekly/monthly training intensity heatmaps
- Performance progression charts
- Exercise type distribution with color coding
- Goal tracking with championship-themed progress bars
- Injury prevention recommendations display"
```

## üéØ **Best Practices**

### **Design Token Usage**
Always use the boxing design tokens for consistency:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Correct - Use design tokens
style={{ color: designTokens.colors.primary.boxing_red }}
style={{ color: designTokens.colors.primary.championship_gold }}

// ‚ùå Incorrect - Hardcoded colors  
className="text-red-600"
className="text-yellow-400"
```

### **Component Development**
Follow the established patterns:

```typescript
// ‚úÖ Proper TypeScript interface usage
interface FightPosterProps {
  event: Event;
  fighters: Fighter[];
  size?: ComponentSize;
  showCountdown?: boolean;
}

// ‚úÖ Design token integration
import { designTokens } from '../../styles/design-tokens';

// ‚úÖ Accessibility compliance
<button
  aria-label={`View ${fighter.name}'s profile`}
  className="focus:ring-2 focus:ring-boxing-red"
>
```

### **MCP Server Selection**
Choose the right server for each task:

- **Quick component generation**: Magic MCP
- **Complex architectural decisions**: Sequential-thinking MCP  
- **Research and documentation**: Context7 MCP
- **File operations and bulk changes**: Filesystem MCP
- **Design file access**: Figma MCP (when files available)
